## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r echo = TRUE}
library(dplyr);

unzip("activity.zip");
activity <- tbl_df(read.csv("activity.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE));
file.remove("activity.csv");
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r echo = TRUE}
dates <- unique(select(activity, date));
daily <- data.frame();
for(day in dates$date) {
	daily <- rbind(daily, summarize(filter(activity, date == day, !is.na(steps)), sum(steps)));
}
colnames(daily) <- "steps";
hist(daily$steps);
print(sapply(daily, mean, na.rm = TRUE));
print(sapply(daily, median, na.rm = TRUE));
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
